# Islandview Digital
Virtual Reality Real Estate Development Entity

Islandview Digital is a recently founded Virtual Reality real estate development entity that seeks to synergistically leverage its landholdings in Decentraland to help increase visibility and public awareness for the play-to-earn and create-to-Earn economies, and for Dev Protocolâ€™s support of creators across fields.

Our collaboration with DEV Protocol would form the first commercial VR real estate development entity that can leverage the scarcity of DCL property holdings, and use its staked rewards to create jobs for 3D developers and builders in the space, contributing to the DCL economy, and giving an APY to all players who support by staking. This would be quite profound, as there exists a large pool of qualified designers who are seeking work and want to play-to-earn/create-to-earn in this metaverse.

DEV buyers and DCL players can rest assured in staking on our development entity knowing that we are the official, long-term collaborator who is building and curating the Dev HQ, as well as other properties around DCL. Our curation and in-metaverse guidance can help assure that DEV Protocol is partnered with a collaborator who invests time and energy into productive, reliable projects and who will not unexpectedly compromise the value of Dev Protocol.

The capital staked on our project will be used to hire 3d artists and programmers who look to DCL to both make a living and contribute to the development of the ecosystem. Furthermore, the earnings we pay to our builders can then be spent in the DCL metaverse to partake in the economy. 3D modelers who earn by working on our development projects will then have the opportunity to use their talent, experience, and earnings to create future experiences, games, structures, etc. 
This activity will further stimulate the decentralized, in-metaverse economy as well as showcase the utility of the Dev Protocol. Not only will Islandview be innovating a way to sustainably pay DCL creators to do what they love, we also intend to open up ample opportunities to promote their portfolio.

In this way we become a sustainable engine for the growth of both Dev Protocol and the Decentraland metaverse. Considering the high number of new players who are keen to know how they can make earnings or gain some kind of in-metaverse yield, and the large community of experienced builders who often petition landowners for work, the existence of one reliable entity that solves both issues would likely be transformative for all involved parties.
